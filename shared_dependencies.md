Shared Dependencies:

1. Django: All files in the project_root/app/ directory and manage.py, settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, and asgi.py in the project_root/ directory are Django-specific files and share the Django framework as a dependency.

2. Models: The models.py file defines the database schema that is used across views.py, forms.py, and utils/ files.

3. Views and URLs: The views.py and urls.py files share the names of the views functions and their corresponding URL patterns.

4. Templates: The HTML files in the templates/app/ directory share the base layout and common elements like header, footer, and navigation bar. They also share the names of the blocks for overriding in child templates.

5. Static Files: The CSS and JS files in the static/app/ directory are shared across all HTML templates.

6. Forms: The forms.py file defines the forms used in the views and templates.

7. Transformers: The transformers.py file exports the function to ingest documents using the stsb-mpnet-base-v2 model. This function is used in views.py and possibly in other utils/ files.

8. Cleaning, Vectorization, Similarity, Update, and Create Document: The cleaning.py, vectorization.py, similarity.py, update.py, and create_document.py files in the utils/ directory export functions that are used in views.py and possibly in other utils/ files.

9. DOM Elements: The JavaScript functions in scripts.js use the id names of DOM elements defined in the HTML templates.

10. Messages: The views.py file and HTML templates share the names of the messages used for user notifications.

11. Requirements: The requirements.txt file lists the Python packages that are dependencies for the entire application.
