Shared Dependencies:

1. Django: Django is the main framework used in all the files for creating the web application.

2. Models: The `models.py` file defines the database schema that is used across the application.

3. Views: The `views.py` file contains functions that handle requests and produce responses, which are used in `urls.py` and templates.

4. URLs: The `urls.py` file contains URL patterns that are used in Django's routing process.

5. Templates: The HTML templates (`index.html`, `upload.html`, `results.html`) share common layout and static files (CSS, JS). They also use context variables provided by views.

6. Static Files: The CSS and JS files are used across the HTML templates for styling and interactivity.

7. Utility Functions: The utility functions (`cleaning.py`, `ranking.py`, `vectorization.py`, `merging.py`, `similarity.py`, `transformer.py`) are used in views for processing the documents.

8. Pretrained Model: The `stsb-mpnet-base-v2` model is used in `transformer.py` for ingesting documents.

9. manage.py: This file is used for administrative tasks and is shared across the project.

10. requirements.txt: This file lists the Python dependencies required by the project.

11. README.md: This file provides instructions for installation and operation, which are relevant to the entire project.

12. DOM Elements: The HTML templates will have DOM elements with unique IDs that JavaScript functions can use. These might include elements like `#uploadButton`, `#fileInput`, `#resultsList`, etc.

13. Message Names: These could be names of Django messages used for flash notifications, such as `file_uploaded`, `processing_complete`, etc.

14. Function Names: These are names of functions defined in views and utility files, such as `upload_file`, `process_documents`, `calculate_similarity`, etc.
